# MyPrintf
Basic implementation of printf function in C.
No stdio.h, only system calls, variadic arguments, string parsing and number to string conversions.
Implemented just simple cases such as 'd', 's', 'c', 'f' and '%'. In this first version I haven't handled other cases like number conversions ('%x' or '%o'), nor explicit precision (%.4f).
